This e-commerce website has been developed using ASP.NET Core 1.0 framework in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.
In order to test the website, open the "WesthoughtonWorldOfWicker.sln" file using Microsoft Visual Studio.

In order to re-create the database and its contents, you can either run the website and click the "database-update"
button which should appear within the browser window instead of the website in the testing mode, 
use the "aspnet-WesthoughtonWorldOfWicker.dacpac" (in the same folder as the Readme) 
that has been exported from the "project", or manually implement migrations using command prompt and file editing.
The manual command prompt method is the most recommended method in this case.

The following paragraph describes the manual implementation of migrations (should the database.dacpac method not work). 
The connection string used to connect to the database is as follows (from "appsettings.json" file):
"Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=aspnet-WesthoughtonWorldOfWicker;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
The database migrations file can be found in the "data/migrations" directory.
----In order to apply the migration file using the manual method 
(migration creates the database and its tables), open the command prompt,navigate 
to the "WesthoughtonWorldOfWicker/src/WesthoughtonWorldOfWicker" using the "cd" command and then issue the following 
command:
"dotnet ef database update" (without the quotation marks)

Once the database is created, run the website (the data is inserted into the tables upon the first run - SeedData.cs model)
In order to test the administrative functions, you need to use the administrator account.
The Administrator username and password are: pj3amt@bolton.ac.uk (username) P@ssw0rd (password)

Remeber to test all the pages, including the "contact" and the "account settings" page
(which can be viewed by clicking the "Hello _____" message that appears after logging in), as well as "Order Review"
that can be accessed from the "My Orders" page. 
Certain buttons require a double click to work (e.g. Remove from cart button/minus sign button)
In order to add contact details (including address) log in, click the "Hello username" message and then click 

Finally, the website does implement the Luhn Algorithm (card validation function), however due to the number being 
stored as a string in the model all the credit/debit card  numbers are required to be entered into the input box 
without spaces or dashes (-). An example: 4034460333157707 (correct credit card number)
